## Crab Fork

Welcome to Crab's fork of the cwtools-hoi4-config. I am working on updating the entire config to support all new NSB modding options as well as fix some issues with the existing configs.

Lots has changed in HOI4 since 2019 (Last time this config was updated) so please bare with me as I update. Feel free to clone and make contributions, just create a branch and Pull Request and I will review and merge when I can.

Thanks!

2. Open VS Code, and go to File, Preferences, Settings
2.a. To make the changes only apply to this folder (not all folders on your computer), change the tab at the top to "workspace settings"
3. Set "cwtools.rules_version" to "manual"
4. Set "cwtools.rules_folder" to the path above. e.g. D:\Git\cwtools-hoi4-config
