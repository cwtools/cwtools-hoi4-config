		"Formatted Localization":	"![MD]\nFormatted localization is a concept for generating texts based on a specific token. It can for example, be used to\ngenerate a description of an idea from the ideas token. A formatted localization entry also accepts standard localization keys\nand raw localization strings giving the following allowed options:\n* A localization tag.\n* A string (can for example be used to inject things based on the [Localization Scope Object](#localization_scope_object) if one exists).\n* A formatter and it's associated tag.\n\nDocumentation for the existing formatters can be found at [Localization formatter](localization_formatter.md).\n\n### Example\n```\n# Using a  formatter\ncustom_effect_tooltip = idea_desc|canadian_pacific_railway\n\n# Using a standard loc key\ncustom_effect_tooltip = WHILE_FOCUSING\n\n# Using a loc string with a localization scope object\ncustom_effect_tooltip = \"[ROOT.GetName]\"\n```\n",
		"Bindable Localization":	"![MD]\nBindable localization is a modular way of binding localization parameters in script for the specified localization key.\nAny variable that accepts a bindable localization accepts the following:\n* A [formatted localization](#formatted_localization).\n* A bound localization object.\n\nThe bound localization object has the following members:\n* `localization_key = KEY`: The localization key that is used for the object.\n* `PARAMETER = BINDABLE_LOC`: A parameter to the localization key that is replaced with the localized version `BINDABLE_LOC`,\n   where `BINDABLE_LOC` is a bound localization object itself.\n\n#### Examples\nThe following are example usages where the `tooltip` is a bindable localization:\n```\ntooltip = MY_TOOLTIP # Simple loc key tooltip\n\n### Loc entries\nMY_TOOLTIP = \"This is a tooltip\"\n\n### Localized result\nThis is a tooltip\n```\n\n```\ntooltip = {\n\tlocalization_key = MY_TOOLTIP # Root look key\n\tIMPORTANT_QUESTION = { # ID IMPORTANT_QUESTION in MY_TOOLTIP will get value:\n\t\tlocalization_key = MEANING_OF_LIFE # Root loc key in IMPORTANT_QUESTION\n\t\tANSWER = \"42\" # ID ANSWER in IMPORTANT_QUESTION will get value 42\n\t}\n\tTHE_REST_IS = UNIMPORTANT\n}\n\n### Loc entries\nMY_TOOLTIP = \"The thing everyone wonders is if $IMPORTANT_QUESTION$. The rest is $THE_REST_IS$.\"\nMEANING_OF_LIFE = \"the meaning of life is $ANSWER$\"\nUNIMPORTANT = \"unimportant\"\n\n### Result\nThe thing everyone wonders is if the meaning of life is 42. The rest is unimportant.\n```\n\n```\n# Using a formatter\ncustom_effect_tooltip = idea_desc|canadian_pacific_railway\n```\n",
		"Script Constants":	"![MD]\nScript constants are a way to define constants in scripts that can be reused in any script file (except for other script constants files).\nIn general, script constants can be used instead of the script macro operator `@` that is file local.\nNote that the script constants has a negligible load time impact and no runtime performance cost.\nLike many other concepts, the script constant is only supported where explicitly stated that it is supported. However, all scoped variables\naccepts script constants that are pointing to a single fixed point value, by using the prefix `constant:`.\n\n#### Reloading\nA script constant is a bit specific when it comes to reloading the database.\nIt's not enough to reload the script constant database itself since script constants are injected into the script on load.\nInstead one have to first reload the script constant database, and then reload the database that uses the script constant.\n\n#### Example\nIn the script constant file, the following constant file definition is made:\n```\nnumeric_constants = {\n    schema = {\n        any_key = yes\n        data = fixed_point # floating point\n    }\n\tpi = 3.14159\n\te = 2.71828\n}\n```\n\nThese can then be used in a script file like this:\n```\nsome_scoped_variable = constant:numeric_constants.pi\nsome_fixed_point_supporting_constants = numeric_constants.e\n```\n\n",
		"Contextual Localization":	"![MD]\nContextual localization is a way to access data from Localization Objects when localizing a string.\nThe concept differs slightly from standard values ($VAL$) that can be injected into the localization string by allowing the localization string\nto select which properties to add to the resulting string and where.\nWhen a string is contextually localized with a localization object, then there's one root object (either a [Scope](loc_objects_documentation.md#scope) or [Localization Environment(loc_objects_documentation.md#localization_environment)].\nIn general this object can only be used for two purposes: Accessing other objects and getting the current date.\n\nThe documentation for the different localization objects can be found at [Localization Objects](loc_objects_documentation.md).\n\n### Using a localization object\nThe localization objects are used with the following syntax: `[(Object.)+Property]`.\n`(Object.)+` refers to a sequence of at least one object accessor and `Property` is the property\nthat is accessed by the last object in the sequence. For example, if the localization string is localized with an [Character](loc_objects_documentation.md#character) object\nthe following queries would get the character's name and the name of the country that the character belongs to `[Character.GetName]`\nand `[Character.Owner.GetName]`, respectively.\n\n### Condition in contextual localization\nConditions in contextual localization can be used to check if objects are null or not. The basic syntax for the condition is `[(OBJECT ? TRUE_CASE : FALSE_CASE)]`.\nWhere:\n* `OBJECT` is any object you can use to access a property from (for example, `Character` and `Character.Owner` are valid objects).\n* `TRUE_CASE` and `FALSE_CASE` are what is to be localized if `OBJECT` is not null and null, respectively. These can hold one of the following values:\n   1. `'LOC_KEY` - A localization key (`LOC_KEY`, note the prepending `'` that means that it's a localization key) that will be localized using the same context as the root contextual localization.\n   2. `(OBJECT.)+Property` - Standard access of a property from an object (discards the object before the `?`). `(OBJECT.)+` stands for a sequence of at least one object, with dots as separators.\n   3. (true case only) `.(OBJECT.)*Property` - Continue that object sequence from the object before the `?`. `(OBJECT.)*` stands for a potentially empty sequence of objects with dots as separators. This is more efficient than the second option since it will not redo the object getters before the `?`.\n\n### Relation to Event Scopes\nWhen a localization string is localized from a scoped context (for example effects or triggers), then the root [Scope](loc_objects_documentation.md#scope) is created\nfrom the event scope of that context. For example, an effect that creates a trade route between two countries `FROM` and `THIS`\ncould be localized with: `LOC_KEY: \"Creates a trade route between [FROM.GetName] and [THIS.GetName]\"`. For more information on\nhow the scope accessors `FROM`, `THIS`, `PREV` and `ROOT` works on `Scope` see TODO: Add link.\n\n### Documentation of localized objects\nIn general a scoped context (for example, effects and triggers) are localized using a [Scope](loc_objects_documentation.md#scope) object based on the scope of that context.\nHowever, there are legacy systems where this may not hold. For other places where localization keys are provided, please see the documentation\nfor which localization objects that are defined for that context."
